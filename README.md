```
I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away, but I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you 'til then

I been running from it, tired of running from it
Scared of feeling something
Now I'm stuck and tryna get up out of this hole
I tried to be strong, I tried to make it work
But I've been feeling too numb

Skies are bleeding on me
Why'd you leave me lonely?
Feeling Whitney Stoney
Now I'm stuck and wonder where I ever went wrong
How could I be strong?
I'm fighting for your love

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away, but I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you 'til then

I don't see light in your love anymore
There ain't no reason in pouring a four
I don't like feelings or feeling like running from something
And feeling so out of control
I know that the feelings are gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hoping you pick up the phone

And ring me when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulder's right, my baby is all that I want
And I'll play them all, of my favorite songs
That lady is my favorite one

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away, but I'll keep runnin'
Just to find a way to you 'til then

Ain't never gonna let you go
Got my heart NASCAR racing
Johnny never fading
He just left you hanging
Fiending for your love
All worth it for the waiting

Give you what you need (give you what you need)
Take you where he won't (take you where he won't)
Can feel it when we're all alone
Know you're wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go

I'll wait 'til you're home
Hold a place 'til you're coming home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you wanna go

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away, but I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you 'til then
