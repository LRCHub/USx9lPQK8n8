I can't wait for you
to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you
till then
I've been running from it
Tired of running from it
Scared of feeling something
Now I'm stuck here tryna get up
outta this hole
I tried to be strong
I tried to make it work
but I've been feeling too numb
Skies are beating on me
Why'd you leave me lonely?
Feeling Whitney, Stoney
Now I'm stuck here wondering
where I ever went wrong
How could I be strong?
I'm fighting for you love
I can't wait for you
to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you
till then
I don't see light
in your love anymore
There ain't no reason to call
in a fall
I don't like feelings and
feeling like running form
something
And feeling so out of control
I know that
the feelings are gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hoping you pick up the phone
And ring me
when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulder's right
My baby's all in the one
And I play them,
all of my favourite songs
That lady is my favourite one
I can't wait for you
to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you
till then
Ain't never gonna let you go
Got my heart, Nascar racing
Shining, never fading
He just left you hanging
Feining for you love
All worth it for the waiting
Give you what you need
Take you where you want
Can feel it when were all alone
Know you're wanting
something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you want it,
girl
I'll wait till you're home
Hold a place
till you're coming home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you want it,
girl
I can't wait for you
to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you
till then
